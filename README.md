# Sales Analysis Dashboard

## üåü Introduction
The **Sales Analysis Dashboard** is a dynamic and interactive Power BI project designed to uncover valuable insights from sales data. This project demonstrates expertise in data transformation, DAX calculations, and interactive visual storytelling. It aims to empower businesses by presenting actionable insights about customers, products, promotions, and sales trends.

## üöÄ Project Overview
This project analyzes sales data from a hypothetical store using Power BI. The goal is to enable stakeholders to identify patterns, track performance, and make informed decisions. The process includes:
- **Data Profiling & Transformation**: Cleaned, merged, and transformed data using Power Query.
- **Interactive Dashboards**: Created highly interactive visualizations across six report pages.
- **Key Business Insights**: Derived actionable insights using calculated metrics and relationships.

## üìÇ Dataset Details
**File Name:** `Store+Data.xlsx`  
The dataset consists of four sheets:
1. **Dim Customers**: Customer details (`Customer ID`, `Customer Name`, `City`, `State`, `Pincode`, `EmailID`, `Phone Number`).
2. **Dim Product**: Product details (`ProductID`, `Product Name`, `Product Line`, `Price Per Unit (INR)`).
3. **Dim Promotion**: Promotion details (`PromotionID`, `Promotion Name`, `Ad Type`, `Coupon Code`, `Price Reduction Type`, `Percentage`).
4. **Fact Table**: Order details (`OrderID`, `Date`, `CustomerID`, `PromotionID`, `ProductID`, `Units Sold`, `Price Per Unit`, `Total Sales`, `Discount Percentage`, `Discount Value`, `Net Sales`, `Profit`).

## üîß Data Transformation
### Key Steps:
- **Index Column**: Added OrderID as a unique identifier starting from 1.
- **Merging Queries**: Joined fact table with dimension tables to enrich data.
- **Calculated Columns**:
  - `Total Sales` = `Units Sold * Price Per Unit`
  - `Discount Value` = Calculated using `Discount Percentage`
  - `Net Sales` = `Total Sales - Discount Value`
  - `Profit` = `Net Sales * 10%` (assumed).
- **Data Profiling**: Ensured data quality by handling null values and duplicates.
- **Relationship Setup**: Established 1-to-many relationships for smooth interaction between tables.
